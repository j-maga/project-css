<p id="java">Java was originally developed by James Gosling.
It was released in May 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems.
The original implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were released by Sun.
The language was initially called Oak after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office.
Later the project went by the name Green and was finally renamed Java, a type of coffee from Indonesia.
Sun Microsystems released the first public implementation as Java 1.0 in 1996.
It promised write once, run anywhere functionality, providing no-cost run-times on popular platforms.
